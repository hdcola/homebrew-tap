  caveats <<~EOS
    OmniVoice #{version} is an internal test build: signed with a self-signed
    certificate, not notarized. Gatekeeper will refuse to open it with something like
    "OmniVoice.app is damaged and can't be opened" until you clear the
    quarantine flag:

      xattr -cr /Applications/OmniVoice.app

    It also needs microphone, speech recognition, and (for system-audio
    capture) screen recording permission on first run. See:
    https://github.com/hdcola/OmniVoice/blob/main/Docs/RELEASE_TESTING.md
